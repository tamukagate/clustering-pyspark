# k-means clustering with pyspark

I used a dataset from books to build 10 clusters on Apache Spark using a clustering algorithm. I
trained the algorithm with the first 135 books and printed the terms found in the first three
clusters. I then selected the 136th book and found out which cluster it belonged to. Using the
Seaborn library, I created a visual that shows the first five clusters.
